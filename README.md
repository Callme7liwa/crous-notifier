# Housing Notification Project

üìñ **Description**

This project automates the notification process for users based on their preferred housing locations. It scrapes housing availability from various sources and notifies users when a match is found.

üèóÔ∏è **Project Overview**

User Registration (Angular Front-End): Users register through an Angular application, providing their email, phone number, and selecting their preferred locations for housing notifications.
Back-End Logic (Spring Boot): Handles user registration, saves data in an SQL database, and listens to Kafka for new housing data.
Data Extraction (Python Script): Extracts housing information from websites such as Leboncoin and MesServices (CROUS) and sends it to Kafka.
Apache Kafka: Facilitates message exchange between Python and Spring Boot services for seamless communication.
Notification Service: Notifies users via email or SMS when new housing opportunities become available.

‚öôÔ∏è **Technologies Used**

- Front-End: Angular
- Back-End: Spring Boot
- Database: SQL Database (e.g., MySQL)
- Data Extraction: Python
- Messaging: Apache Kafka
- Notification: Email & SMS Services

üöÄ **How It Works**

Users register via an Angular web interface, providing the required information.
User data is saved in an SQL database via Spring Boot.
The Python script scrapes available housing data from Leboncoin and MesServices (CROUS).
Extracted data is produced to Kafka and saved as a CSV file.
Spring Boot listens for Kafka messages and matches users based on their preferences.
Users are notified about matching housing opportunities via email or SMS.
